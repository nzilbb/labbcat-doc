# Part of Speech Tagging

There are two automated annotators that can be used to tag word tokens with 
disambiguated part of speech tags; i.e. labels like 'Noun', "Adjective', etc. 
which are determined by taking into account the context of the word being tagged:

- CLAN's MOR tagger
- Stanford CoreNLP's [POS Tagger](stanford-pos-tagger.qmd)
