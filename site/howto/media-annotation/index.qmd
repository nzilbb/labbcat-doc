# Annotating Media

Some automatic annotation processes do not involve reference to the transcript text,
but rather involve computations that come directly and solely from the media.

LaBB-CAT includes annotation modules that integrate with some 3rd-party tools that produce such computations:

- Reaper - for automated voicing and pitch measurement.
- [MediaPipe](mediapipe.qmd) - for detecting facial features in video recordings.
