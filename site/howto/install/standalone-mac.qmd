# Installing LaBB-CAT on Mac OS X systems

:::{.callout-important}
LaBB-CAT can only be installed on newer M-series Macs.

These instructions will not work for older Intel-based Macs. Sorry!
:::

On OS X, there are two prerequisites that must be installed 
before you can install LaBB-CAT:

1. Homebrew
2. Java

You may already have one or other of these installed; if so, you can skip the corresponding
section below.

### 1. Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a 'package manager' for Mac computers, which allows you to install other programes, including Java.

1. Open the following page in your web browser:\
   <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/latest>
2. Scroll down to the *Assets* section.\
   ![Assets](homebrew-assets.png){#fig-homebrew-asset width="200" title="Assets available for download including the .pkg installer, and the source code"}
3. Click the file called *Homebrew-n.n.n.pkg* (where *n.n.n* is the version number) to download the file.
4. Once the file has been downloaded, double-click on it to run the installer.\

5. Click *Continue*, *Continue*, *Agree* and *Install* to complete the installation.

### 2. Install Java

1. Open *Launchpad* and type `Terminal`.
2. Double click *Terminal* to open a command shell.
3. Type in the following command:\
   `brew install openjdk`
4. Press the {{< kbd return >}} key on your keyboard to enter the command.\
   Some text will appear in the *Terminal* window while Homebrew downloads everything it needs to install Java\
   Once it's finished, you'll see the `%` shell prompt again.

    <https://sourceforge.net/projects/labbcat/files/install/>\
    This page has all versions of the LaBB-CAT installer, both for personal computer installations\
    and also for web-server installations. The the files are listed most recent first.

    You will see another warning message as shown in @fig-open-anyway
    
![Open Anyway (again)](open-anyway.png){#fig-open-anyway width="40%" title="'Apple is not able to verify that it is free from malware...' with buttons: Move to Trash, Open Anyway, and Done"}

(@) Press *Open Anyway*.\
    You may see a request for Java to access your Downloads folder like in @fig-java-access-downloads.

![Allow Java access to Downloads](java-access-downloads.png){#fig-java-access-downloads width="50%" title="'java' would like to access files in your Downloads folder, with buttons Don't Allow and Allow"}

You should see a progress bar while components are installed and files are copied.

## Uninstalling LaBB-CAT

In future you may want to uninstall LaBB-CAT, in which case you can use the same installer you used to install it.

If you run *install-labbcat_yyyymmdd.jar* and LaBB-CAT is already installed, 
after pressing *Start* it will offer further options.

![Running *install-labbcat_yyyymmdd.jar* when LaBB-CAT is already installed](uninstall-labbcat.png){title="An 'Already Installed' window, with buttons: Cancel, Uninstall, Replace, and Upgrade"}

The options are:

- **Upgrade** -- Install this version of LaBB-CAT, keeping all your corpus data intact.
- **Replace** -- Install LaBB-CAT afresh, deleting all your existing corpus data and leaving you with an empty LaBB-CAT installation.
- **Uninstall** -- Remove LaBB-CAT from your personal computer.
- **Cancel** -- Close the installer without taking any action.
