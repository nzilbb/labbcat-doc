## Installing Praat Browser Integration

When you are browsing a LaBB-CAT corpus (either installed on your own computer or on a server),
the transcript page can integrate directly with Praat so that you can open utterance in Praat
directly from your browser.

:::{.callout-important}
LaBB-CAT's browser integration with Praat currently **does not work** with *Safari*, 
so if you're using a Mac, ensure you try the steps below in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Mozilla Firefox.
:::

In order for this to work, you need some software installed on your local computer:

### 1. Install Praat

If you don't already have Praat, or you have a version older than <b>6.2.05</b>, download and install Praat from the Praat website:

<http://praat.org>
    
### 2. Install *Java* if it's not already installed

Java may already be installed on you system. The steps for discovering if Java is already installed, 
and how to install it if it's not, depend on your operating system:

::::{#java-windows .callout-note collapse=true}
#### ![](windows-start.jpg){height="30px" style="vertical-align: bottom;"} Windows 

On Windows, before you can install LaBB-CAT, you first must have Java installed.

##### 1. Check Java

Use the following steps to check whether you already have Java installed.

1. Press the ![](windows-start.jpg){height="22px" style="vertical-align: bottom;"} Start menu button.
2. Type `Control Panel`
3. Select the *Control Panel* option that appears.\
   ![](control-panel-icon.png){title="The Windows Control Panel menu item"}
4. Type `Java`

If a *Java* icon appears as shown in @fig-control-panel-java, then you already have Java, and can skip section 2.

![Java in the Control Panel](control-panel-java.png){#fig-control-panel-java width="70%" title="Java in the Control Panel"}

If there's no *Java* icon in the Control Panel, follow the steps in the next section to install it.

##### 2. Install Java

1. Open the Java website in your browser:\
   <https://www.java.com/>
2. Press the *Download Java* button.
3. Press the *Download Java* button on the next page and save the resulting installer file.

:::{.callout-important}
These instructions are for newer M-series Macs, and will not work for older Intel-based Macs. Sorry!
:::

On OS X, there are a various ways to install Java.

You can try the Java website in your browser:\
   <https://www.java.com/>

Or you can use the 'Homebrew' package management system.

You may already have one or other of these installed; if so, you can skip the corresponding
section below.

##### 1. Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a 'package manager' for Mac computers, which allows you to install other programes, including Java.

1. Open the following page in your web browser:\
   <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/latest>
2. Scroll down to the *Assets* section.\
   ![Assets](homebrew-assets.png){#fig-homebrew-asset width="200" title="Assets available for download including the .pkg installer, and the source code"}
3. Click the file called *Homebrew-n.n.n.pkg* (where *n.n.n* is the version number) to download the file.
4. Once the file has been downloaded, double-click on it to run the installer.\
   ![Homebrew Installer](homebrew-installer.png){#fig-homebrew-installer width="50%" title="The Homebrew installer"}
5. Click *Continue*, *Continue*, *Agree* and *Install* to complete the installation.

##### 2. Install Java

1. Open *Launchpad* and type `Terminal`.
2. Double click *Terminal* to open a command shell.
3. Type in the following command:\
   `brew install openjdk`
4. Press the {{< kbd return >}} key on your keyboard to enter the command.\
   Some text will appear in the *Terminal* window while Homebrew downloads everything it needs to install Java\
   Once it's finished, you'll see the `%` shell prompt again.

![brew install openjdk](brew-install-openjdk.png){#fig-brew-install-openjdk title="Terminal window after running 'brew install openjdk'"}

::::

### 3. Install the *Praat Integration* browser extension

1. In LaBB-CAT, open any transcript.
2. On the top-right of the transcript page, above the playback
    controls, there's a Praat icon ![](praat-integration.png){height="16px"} - click
    it.
3. Follow the instructions that appear (these vary depending on what web browser you use).

You may need to grant a browser extension permission to install, and
it's possible you will need a connection to the internet in order
to download this extension.

### 4. Install the *Praat Messaging Host*

1. Once you've installed the browser extension, return to the transcript page.
2. Press *OK* on the message that appears, to reload the page.
3. Click on any line, and select the 'Open Text Grid in Praat' option on the menu.

You will see a page with three-step instructions for finishing the Praat integration.

Assuming you already have Praat and Java installed, you just have to do the third step.
i.e. download and run a program called
"install-jsendpraat.jar". 

4. Click the *install-jsendpraat.jar* link, save the resulting file.
5. Double-click the program you just saved.
6. On the window that appears, press the *Install* button.

::::{#mac .callout-note collapse=true}

## Mac Installation

When you try to run *install-jsendpraat.jar* on a Mac, you may see the following message:

![](mac-install-jsendpraat-not-opened.png){alt="install-jsendpraat.jar Not Opened - buttons Done or Move to Trash" width=50%}


If so:

a. Press *Done*.
b. Click the Apple icon on the top left corner of the screen to open the menu.
c. Select *System Settings...*
d. On the left hand side, select the *Privacy and Security* option.
e. Scroll to the bottom of the page.\
   Under *Security* you should seem a message saying\
   *"install-sendpraat.jar" was blocked to protect your Mac*\
   ![](mac-open-anyway.png)
   
f. Press *Open Anyway*\
   You will see a warning message:\
   ![](mac-open-install-jsendpraat.png){width=50%}
   
g. Press *Open Anyway*\
   You may see a further prompt to allow this:\
   ![](mac-allow.png)
   
Finally you should see the installer open:

![](mac-install-jsendpraat-installer.png)

Then you can press *Install*.

::::

7. You also may be asked where Praat is installed; Navigate to the
   location where Praat is installed, and double-click the "Praat.exe"
   file (on some systems the file may simply be called "Praat"). The
   Praat program may open, and then immediately close, as LaBB-CAT
   tests it can communicate with Praat.

7. Close the instructions page.

If in doubt, check the ![](help.png){height="16px"} online help on the transcript
page; it has a section explaining how to set up Praat integration on
various browsers and operating systems.

Now Praat integration has been set up, and you should be able to
access Praat options in the transcript page from now on...
