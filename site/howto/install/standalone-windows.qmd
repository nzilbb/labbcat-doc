# Installing LaBB-CAT on Windows

LaBB-CAT is a web-browser based application, and is primarily designed to run
on a central web server accessible over the internet, so that multiple collaborators
can easily work on the same corpus data from different locations.

However, it is possible to have a 'private' installation of LaBB-CAT which runs
directly on your personal computer. These instructions explain how to achieve that.

On Windows, before you can install LaBB-CAT, you first must have Java installed.

### 1. Check Java

Use the following steps to check whether you already have Java installed.

1. Press the ![](windows-start.jpg){height="22px" style="vertical-align: bottom;"} Start menu button.
2. Type `Control Panel`
3. Select the *Control Panel* option that appears.\
   ![](control-panel-icon.png){title="The Windows Control Panel menu item"}
4. Type `Java`

If a *Java* icon appears as shown in @fig-control-panel-java, then you already have Java, and can skip section 2.

![Java in the Control Panel](control-panel-java.png){#fig-control-panel-java width="70%" title="Java in the Control Panel"}

If there's no *Java* icon in the Control Panel, follow the steps in the next section to install it.

### 2. Install Java

1. Open the Java website in your browser:\
   <https://www.java.com/>
2. Press the *Download Java* button.
3. Press the *Download Java* button on the next page and save the resulting installer file.
4. Click the installer to run it.

6. Press *Close*.

### 3. Install LaBB-CAT

Once Java is installed, you can install LaBB-CAT:

(@) Open the following page in your web browser:\
    <https://sourceforge.net/projects/labbcat/files/install/>\
    This page has all versions of the LaBB-CAT installer, both for personal computer installations\
    and also for web-server installations. The the files are listed most recent first.
(@) Download the first file named *install-labbcat_yyyymmdd.jar* (where *yyyymmdd* are numbers).
(@) Double-click on the file you just downloaded to open it.

You should see the LaBB-CAT installer program (@fig-install-labbcat-windows).

![LaBB-CAT Installer](install-labbcat-windows.png){#fig-install-labbcat-windows width="70%" title="The LaBB-CAT installer with buttons: Start and Cancel"}

(@) Press *Start*.

You should see a progress bar while components are installed and files are copied.

Once the installation is finished, the progress bar will be all blue, 
and there will be a button labelled *Finished* (@fig-install-labbcat-finished).

![Installer finished](install-labbcat-finished-windows.png){#fig-install-labbcat-finished width="70%" title="The LaBB-CAT installer with the message 'Installation complete' and a 'Finished' button to close it"}

(@) Press *Finished*.

The LaBB-CAT Server application will appear, as shown in @fig-labbcat-windows.

![LaBB-CAT Server](labbcat-windows.png){#fig-labbcat-windows width="70%" title="The LaBB-CAT Server app must be open while you're using LaBB-CAT"}

Then your default web browser will open on your LaBB-CAT home page, as shown in @fig-LaBB-CAT-home-windows.

![LaBB-CAT is successfully installed and running](LaBB-CAT-home-windows.png){#fig-LaBB-CAT-home-windows title="The LaBB-CAT home page"}

(@) If you are shown the LaBB-CAT Licence page, scroll to the bottom and press *I Agree*.

As seen in @fig-start-menu-labb-cat, in your Start Menu, 
you will see that there is a LaBB-CAT app that can be used to 
start and access LaBB-CAT from now on.

![Use Start/LaBB-CAT to open LaBB-CAT](start-menu-labb-cat.png){#fig-start-menu-labb-cat width="50%" title="The LaBB-CAT Start Menu item"}

This starts the LaBB-CAT Server app (@fig-labbcat-windows), which must be 
running when you're using LaBB-CAT. 
It can be closed once you've finished working with LaBB-CAT.

## Uninstalling LaBB-CAT

In future you may want to uninstall LaBB-CAT, in which case you can use the same installer you used to install it.

If you run *install-labbcat_yyyymmdd.jar* and LaBB-CAT is already installed, 
after pressing *Start* it will offer further options.

![Running *install-labbcat_yyyymmdd.jar* when LaBB-CAT is already installed](uninstall-labbcat.png){title="An 'Already Installed' window, with buttons: Cancel, Uninstall, Replace, and Upgrade"}

The options are:

- **Upgrade** -- Install this version of LaBB-CAT, keeping all your corpus data intact.
- **Replace** -- Install LaBB-CAT afresh, deleting all your existing corpus data and leaving you with an empty LaBB-CAT installation.
- **Uninstall** -- Remove LaBB-CAT from your personal computer.
- **Cancel** -- Close the installer without taking any action.
