Once MFA has been installed, you have to install the MFA Manager, which is the LaBB-CAT module that provides MFA with all the data it needs, and then saves to alignments MFA produces back to your database.

1. Select the *layer managers* menu option.
1. Follow the *List of layer managers that are not yet installed* link.
1. Find *MFA Manager* in the list, and press its *Install* button and then press *Install* again.\
   As long as MFA has been installed for all users, you should see a box that's already filled in with the location that MFA was installed to.
1. Click *Configure* to continue the layer manager installation.\
   You will see a window open with some information about integrating with MFA, including the information you've already read above.
