# Phonemic Tagging with the Spanish Phonology Transcriber

This layer manager annotates Spanish words their phonemic transcription, based on rules that map orthography to phonology.

Rule-based conversion is based on 
[spanish-pronunciation-rules-php](https://github.com/easypronunciation/spanish-pronunciation-rules-php), 
an open-source PHP function that converts a Spanish word into IPA phonetic transcription symbols, written by Timur Baytukalov,

## Creating a Phonemes Layer

To create a new layer with annotations from your dictionary:

1. Select the *word layers* option on the menu - this will display a list of all the word layers you already have in the database.
1. At the top of the list, there's a blank form for creating a new layer  - fill this form in:
    - *Layer ID* - enter a one- or two-word description - e.g. phonemes
    - *Type* - select Phonological
    - *Manager* - select Spanish phonological transcriber
    - *Alignment* - select *None* (as these are simply tags on the orthographic words)
    - *Generate* - select Always
1. Press the *New* button to create the layer. 
    You will see the layer configuration page. Check the online help for explanations of all options, but at least:
1. Ensure the *Source Layer* is *orthography*
1. Select the desired *Locale* from the list.

1. Press *Save*
1. Press *Regenerate*.  
    You will see a progress bar while the layer manager annotates all the transcripts that have already been uploaded.

LaBB-CAT will then generate annotations for all the transcripts you already have in your database.  If you have a lot of data, this may take a while.  

From now on, when you upload a new transcript, annotations will automatically be generated by using the mapping rules for the selected locale.
