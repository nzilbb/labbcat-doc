# Changing Corpus

The 'corpus' and the 'episode' of a transcript belongs to is specified when it is uploaded; every transcript belongs to an 'episode' (which groups together transcripts from the same recording session), and each episode belongs to a 'corpus'

What if you choose the wrong corpus, or change your mind about episode name later? You can use the *episode organiser* option on the menu to make such changes after uploading transcripts.

The organiser appears as a list of collapsable 'folders' that represent existing corpora, containing episodes:

## Changing Corpus

To move an episode from one corpus to another, simply drag the episode with your mouse and drop it on to the desired corpus (if you want a new corpus, you must add it first using the *corpora* option on the menu).

## Renaming an Episode

To rename an episode, right-click on the episode and select the *Rename* option.
