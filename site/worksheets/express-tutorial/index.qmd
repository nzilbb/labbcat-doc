# LaBB-CAT Express Tutorial

This tutorial is a very brief introduction to the LaBB-CAT corpus analysis tool. There are four exercises, in which you:

- [install LaBB-CAT on your personal computer](1-installation.qmd),
- [upload a small corpus of recordings into your database and explore the transcript page](2-upload-data.qmd),
- [add autonmatically generateed part-of-speech tags](3-stanford-pos.qmd) and,
- [add autonmatically generateed pronunciation tags](4-cmudict.qmd) and,
- [compute the start/end times of each speech sound](5-bas-webmaus.qmd) and extract automated formant measurements from vowels.
