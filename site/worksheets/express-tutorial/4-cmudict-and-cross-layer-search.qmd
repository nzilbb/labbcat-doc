# 4 - The CMU Dictionary and Cross Layer Searching

LaBB-CAT can be integrated with the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, which is
a free pronounciation dictionary of English maintained by the Speech
Group in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
The pronunciations are based on American English, so are suitable for
American English recordings.

It can also serve as a free alternative to the CELEX lexicon (which is
based on British English), for those that have not purchased CELEX,
although is less ideal for 'non-rhotic' varieties of English.

In this exercise you will:

1.  install the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary layer manager,
2.  use it to create new annotations for word pronunciations, and 
3.  incorporate the new layers in more sophisticated searches.

## Install the CMU Dictionary

The first thing we're going to to is install the CMU Pronouncing
Dictionary layer manager...

1.  Select the *layer managers* menu option.\
    You will see a list of pre-installed layer managers, which are
    modules that can perform automatic annotation tasks. The CMU Pronouncing
    Dictionary layer manager isn't pre-installed, because it is language-specific.
2.  Follow the *List of layer managers that are not yet installed* link
    near the bottom.
3.  Find *CMU Pronouncing Dictionary* in the list, and press its
    *Install* button.
4.  Press *Install* on the resulting information page.\
    This displays some further information about the layer manager,
    allowing you to upload an alternative version of the dictionary
    file.\
    We be using the standard file that is included with the layer
    manager.
5.  Press *Configure*.\
    You will see a progress bar while the layer manager loads the data
    from the dictionary file into the LaBB-CAT database. This will take
    a minute or so.
6.  Once it's finished, you will see a new window open with information
    about the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary layer manager.
    
## Annotate Words with Pronunciations    
    
Now that we've installed the layer manager, we'll create a layer
that contains word pronunciations.

7.  Select the *word layers* option on the menu.\
    You will see a list of existing word layers, including the
    *orthography* layer, the *lexical* layer, etc.
8.  The column headings are also a form for defining a new word layer.
    Fill in the following details in this form:
    -   **Layer ID:** `phonemes`
    -   **Type:** *Phonological*
    -   **Alignment:** *None*
    -   **Manager:** *CMU Pronouncing Dictionary*
    -   **Description:** `All possible phonemic transcriptions for each word.`
9.  Press *New* to add the layer.\
    You will see the layer configuration form.
10. Set the **Encoding** field to *CELEX DISC*, and the default values
    for everything else.

options do, hover your mouse over each one to see further
information about what the setting does.
:::

11. Press *Set Parameters*.\
    You will see a message asking you if you want (re)generate the layer
    data now.
12. Press *Regenerate*.\
    You will see a progress bar moving across the page while the
    annotations are being generated. When it is finished, you will see a
    message saying *Layer complete*.
13. Once the layer has finished generating, click the transcripts menu
    option, and open the first transcript in the list.
14. Tick your new *phonemes* layer.\
    You will see that each word is tagged with a phonemic transcription.
    You will notice that the annotations are displayed using IPA
    symbols. However, the layer manager doesn't use IPA symbols
    directly, it actually uses the 'DISC' encoding for phonemes, which
    uses ordinary 'typewriter' characters (ASCII), and uses exactly one
    character per phoneme.\
    The IPA symbols are being displayed by LaBB-CAT to provide a
    linguist-friendly representation of the phonemic transcription. But
    you can see the underlying DISC characters by selecting the *ASCII*
    option on the layer in the transcript.
15. Select *ASCII* on the phonemes layer, to see what the layer manager
    is actually producing.\
    You may find that this is somewhat harder to read. It's similar to
    the 'SAMPA' system for encoding phonemes, but diphthongs are
    generally represented by digits, and various other characters are
    used to represent affricates, etc.
16. Select *IPA* on the phonemes layer, to return to the IPA view of the
    layer.

## Search Across Layers

It's nice to display the IPA symbols, but it's important to
understand the DISC symbols (shown in the table below), because they
are what we have to use when searching on the phonemes layer, which
we are going to try now.

There is
another possible representation of the pronunciations, called
ARPABET; this is what is used in the original dictionary file
published by CMU, and uses up to three uppercase characters per
phoneme. While we're not using ARPABET in this exercise, you can
use it if you like, and the ARPABET symbols are included in the
table. In the table, there are gaps where no
ARPABET version of the phoneme is shown; this means that the CMU
Pronouncing Dictionary contains no entries that include that
phoneme.

17. Select the *search* option on the menu, which allows you to search
    all participants by default.
2.  If it's not already ticked, tick the new *phonemes* layer.\
    Now you will see that our search matrix is two layers high by one
    word wide.\
    ![The search matrix shows a frame labelled 'orthography' above and
    a frame labelled 'phonemes' below, both with a 'matches'
    dropdown box and an empty 'regular expression' box. The
    'phonemes' frame also includes a small button labelled:
    «](two-layers-high.png)
3.  Search your new *phonemes* layer for words that start with `h` by
    entering the appropriate regular expression in the *phonemes* box.\
    You will see that the results contain words that you might not
    expect, like "where", "which" and "when".
4.  Click one of these unexpected results, to open the transcript.\
    You will see that, in the transcript, the pronunciation appears to
    start with /w/, not with /h/.
5.  Click on the word and select the bottom *Edit* option on the menu
    that appears.\
    This opens a small window that displays all annotations on that word
    token.\
    Now look for the *phonemes* layer. You will see that, in addition to
    the pronunciation that starts with /w/, there's another annotation
    that starts with /h/, which is invisible on the transcript.\
    These are all the possible phonemic transcriptions for the word,
    ordered most-frequent first. Only the first one is displayed in the
    transcript, but when you do searches, all of them are searched. This
    can result in unexpected matches like this, but it can be useful, as
    it ensures that when you search for a particular phonemic pattern,
    all possible tokens are returned, not just those that match on the
    most 'normal' transcription.\

Now that we have phonemic transcripts, we can do a better job of the
search we tried in the earlier exercise - "the" followed by a word
starting with a vowel...

22.  Go to the *search* page.
7.  Create a search matrix that's two words wide, and includes the
    *orthography* and *phonemes* layers.
8.  Type `the` in the first *orthography* box.
9.  Click the second box on the *phonemes* layer, but don't enter
    anything in the box yet.\
    The box has a little symbol `«` to the right of it.
10. Hover the mouse over it to see what it says, and then click it.\
    You will see that a section opens with a bunch of phoneme symbols on
    it; clicking on a phoneme adds its DISC representation to the search
    box.
11. You could use the square-brackets `[` at the start of your pattern,
    and click all vowel symbols to add all possible vowels - Note that
    the vowels in the DISC representation extend beyond a, e, i, o, and
    u - you should add in all the vowels you see in the list that
    appears when you expand the IPA helper, including all the
    diphthongs.\
    \
    *Alternatively*, you can simply click the *VOWEL* link in the
    'phoneme symbol selector', which will add all the DISC vowels for
    you, already enclosed in square-brackets.
12. Be sure to append the 'any vowel' regular expression with `.*` to
    ensure the search matches words that have phonemes after the initial
    vowel
13. Run the search and check that it's giving you what you expect.
    Notice that now there are no 'false positives' like "the one" that
    we were getting when searching by orthography alone.

Now that you've generated an annotation layer, and have seen how the
search matrix works, you might want to try out some of the following
searches, or invent some others:

-   Words which have the DRESS vowel as the second phoneme
-   Words ending with a front vowel, followed by words beginning with
    /p/ or /b/
-   Words that begin with "k" in their spelling, but begin with the
    phoneme /n/
-   Words that begin with "k" in their spelling, but *do not* begin with
    the phoneme /n/
