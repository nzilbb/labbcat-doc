# Installing LaBB-CAT
<!-- 4:30-4:35 - 5 minutes -->

LaBB-CAT is a web-browser based application, and is primarily designed to run
on a central web server accessible over the internet, so that multiple collaborators
can easily work on the same corpus data from different locations.

However, it is possible to have a 'private' installation of LaBB-CAT which runs
directly on your personal computer. These instructions explain how to achieve that.

On Windows, before you can install LaBB-CAT, you first must have Java installed.

### 1. Check Java

Use the following steps to check whether you already have Java installed.

1. Press the ![](windows-start.jpg){height="22px" style="vertical-align: bottom;"} Start menu button.
2. Type `Control Panel`
3. Select the *Control Panel* option that appears.\

4. Type `Java`

If a *Java* icon appears as shown in @fig-control-panel-java, then you already have Java, and can skip section 2.

If there's no *Java* icon in the Control Panel, follow the steps in the next section to install it.

    This page has all versions of the LaBB-CAT installer, both for personal computer installations\
    and also for web-server installations. The the files are listed most recent first.
(@) Download the first file named *install-labbcat_yyyymmdd.jar* (where *yyyymmdd* are numbers).
(@) Double-click on the file you just downloaded to open it.

You should see the LaBB-CAT installer program (@fig-install-labbcat-windows).

(@) Press *Start*.

You should see a progress bar while components are installed and files are copied.

Once the installation is finished, the progress bar will be all blue, 
and there will be a button labelled *Finished* (@fig-install-labbcat-finished).

(@) Press *Finished*.

The LaBB-CAT Server application will appear, as shown in @fig-labbcat-windows.

![LaBB-CAT Server](labbcat-windows.png){#fig-labbcat-windows width="70%" title="The LaBB-CAT Server app must be open while you're using LaBB-CAT"}

Then your default web browser will open on your LaBB-CAT home page, as shown in @fig-LaBB-CAT-home-windows.

This starts the LaBB-CAT Server app (@fig-labbcat-windows), which must be 
running when you're using LaBB-CAT. 
It can be closed once you've finished working with LaBB-CAT.

These instructions will not work for older Intel-based Macs. Sorry!
:::

On OS X, there are two prerequisites that must be installed 
before you can install LaBB-CAT:

1. Homebrew
2. Java

You may already have one or other of these installed; if so, you can skip the corresponding
section below.

### 1. Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a 'package manager' for Mac computers, which allows you to install other programes, including Java.

1. Open the following page in your web browser:\
   <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/latest>
2. Scroll down to the *Assets* section.\
   ![Assets](homebrew-assets.png){#fig-homebrew-asset width="200" title="Assets available for download including the .pkg installer, and the source code"}
3. Click the file called *Homebrew-n.n.n.pkg* (where *n.n.n* is the version number) to download the file.
4. Once the file has been downloaded, double-click on it to run the installer.\
   ![Homebrew Installer](homebrew-installer.png){#fig-homebrew-installer width="50%" title="The Homebrew installer"}
5. Click *Continue*, *Continue*, *Agree* and *Install* to complete the installation.

### 2. Install Java

1. Open *Launchpad* and type `Terminal`.
2. Double click *Terminal* to open a command shell.
3. Type in the following command:\
   `brew install openjdk`
4. Press the {{< kbd return >}} key on your keyboard to enter the command.\
   Some text will appear in the *Terminal* window while Homebrew downloads everything it needs to install Java\
   Once it's finished, you'll see the `%` shell prompt again.

## Uninstalling LaBB-CAT

If you run *install-labbcat_yyyymmdd.jar* and LaBB-CAT is already installed, 
after pressing *Start* it will offer further options.

![Running *install-labbcat_yyyymmdd.jar* when LaBB-CAT is already installed](uninstall-labbcat.png){title="An 'Already Installed' window, with buttons: Cancel, Uninstall, Replace, and Upgrade"}

The options are:

- **Replace** -- Install LaBB-CAT afresh, deleting all your existing corpus data and leaving you with an empty LaBB-CAT installation.
- **Uninstall** -- Remove LaBB-CAT from your personal computer.
- **Cancel** -- Close the installer without taking any action.
