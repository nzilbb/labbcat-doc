# 1 - Install and Configure LaBB-CAT

In this exercise you will:

-   Install the LaBB-CAT software
-   Define corpora
-   Define transcript types

After this you will have an empty LaBB-CAT database set up ready to
upload transcripts into.

## Installation

You should only follow these steps if you will be running LaBB-CAT on your own computer.

If you are using a LaBB-CAT server that's already been installed for you elsewhere, you can skip to [Setup] below.

(@) You have a file called *install-labbcat.jar* - double click this
    file to start the installer.

:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}
## If you are using OS X
On Mac OS X you may see a message that the file can't be opened:
![](install-labbcat-OSX-warning.png)

If this happens:

1.  Click the Apple icon in the top left corner of the screen.
2.  Select *System Preferences*
3.  Click *Security & Privacy*\
    Near the bottom it says "*install-labbcat.jar" was blocked
    from opening because it is not from an identified developer.*\
    ![](install-labbcat-OSX-open-anyway.png)
4.  Click *Open Anyway*\
    You may see another warning about the program being downloaded
    from the internet\
    ![](install-labbcat-OSX-open.png)
5.  Click *Open*\
    *![](install-labbcat.png)*Â 
:::

(@)  Click *Start*\
    You will see the progress bar move as files are installed. Once this
    is finished, you'll see a message saying "*Installation complete.*"
3.  Click *Finished* to close the installer

The software is now installed. LaBB-CAT is a browser-based system, which
means that it works as a mini web server on your computer, and you need
to access it using your web browser.

Each time you want to use LaBB-CAT, you must start it up, and which
you've finished, you close it down again.

To start LaBB-CAT, click the LaBB-CAT icon in your applications area.

-   On Windows, open the *Start* menu and type LaBB-CAT.
-   On OS X you will find LaBB-CAT in your *Applications* folder.

A window called "LaBB-CAT Server" will open, and after a short delay,
your default web browser will open on a page called "LaBB-CAT".

## Setup {#sec-setup}

Now we will set up a basic structure for receiving data:

1.  Open your web browser on LaBB-CAT's start page.
2.  The very first time the page opens, you will see the software's
    licence. Press *I Agree* to access the start page.
3.  The start page has a link on it called "*Where do I start?*" - you
    may like to click on this link and read the first section, which
    explains a little about how to navigate around LaBB-CAT and where to
    find online help and hints.
4.  Click back on the start page of LaBB-CAT (the page with the "*Where
    do I start?*" link).

Now we will set up some corpus names...

5.  On the menu at the top, select the *corpora* link.\
    This page shows a list of current corpora, which only contains one
    corpus, called *corpus*.
6.  The column headings at the top, *Name*, *Language*, and
    *Description*, also make a form you can fill in to create a new
    corpus. Fill in the following information:
    -   **Name:** `QB`
    -   **Language:** *English*
    -   **Description:** `Quakebox recordings`
7.  Press the *New* button on the right to add the *QB* corpus.\
    You should see a message at the top of the page saying "Record
    created" and now the *QB* corpus is in the list, under the *corpus*
    corpus.
8.  Add another corpus called `UC` with the description `Campus recordings`
9.  We won't actually be using the corpus called *corpus*, so we want
    to delete it. To do this, press the *Delete* button to the right of
    the 'corpus' corpus in the list.
10. You will be asked "Are you sure you want to delete this record?"\
    You are sure, so press *OK*\
    The row will be deleted from the list.

Now you have some corpora set up with the names you've provided.

The data we are using is a collection of stories about peoples'
experiences during the devastating earthquakes that hit the
Canterbury region of New Zealand in 2010 and 2011. Some recordings
are interviews, where an interviewer asks the participant questions,
and others are monologues. Now we're going to set up these two
transcript types ...

11. Select on the *transcript types* menu option.\
    You will see a list of transcript types, although there's currently
    only one type in the list, called 'interview'.
12. Above this, fill in the empty *Type* box with the word: `monologue`
13. Press the *New* button on the right.\
    You will notice that now the list has two transcript types,
    *interview* and *monologue*.
14. Press the *Save* button that has appeared below the other buttons to
    confirm this change.\
    You will see a message at the top saying "Layer saved: transcript_type".

---

Now you have an empty database for which you've:

-   created two corpora, QB and UC, and
-   created a new transcript type, so that we can have monologues as
    well as interviews.
