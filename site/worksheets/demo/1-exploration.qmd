LaBB-CAT is a speech/language corpus management system that:

-   stores transcripts with audio/video
    -   supporting a variety of formats
    -   and the definition of speech elicitation tasks;
-   allows the addition of different layers of annotation, which can
    -   be manual or automatic, and
    -   have different granularities, from topic tagging to individual
        phones;
-   supports forced alignment to phone level using a speech recognition
    toolkit called "HTK", or the [Montreal Forced
    Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/), or the
    [WebMAUS](https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASWebServices/interface/WebMAUSBasic)
    service provided by [BAS Web
    Services](https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASWebServices/);
-   allows cross-layer regular-expression search;
-   search results are exportable to CSV for further analysis;
-   batch acoustic measurement of segments using Praat is also
    supported, and
-   transcripts and fragments of them are exportable in a variety of
    formats.

In this worksheet you will start exploring a demo LaBB-CAT corpus, to
get a general idea of how to find your way around LaBB-CAT and how the
language data is presented.

The demo corpus contains a collection of videos of people telling
stories about their experiences during the earthquakes that struck
Canterbury during 2010 and 2011. They have been orthographically
transcribed using a tool called [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan),
so they have been time aligned to the utterance level; i.e. the start
and end time of each line in the transcript has been manually
synchronized with the recording. The ELAN transcripts, and their video
and audio files, have been uploaded into LaBB-CAT.

LaBB-CAT is a browser-based system so the first thing to do is access it
with your web browser. Generally, any modern browser should be fine
(although some features you'll see in later worksheets are only
supported by Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome).

1.  In your web browser, type in the following URL:\
    [https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/demo](https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/demo/)\
    You will be asked for a username and password.

:::{.callout-important}
If typing this out manually, ensure you enter 'https' not 'http'
:::

2.  The username is *demo* and the password is *demo*\
    The very first time you access LaBB-CAT, you will see its licence
    agreement.
3.  Scroll to the bottom of the page and click *I Agree* to continue.\
    You will see a page called "LaBB-CAT Demo" which has a menu of links
    along the top and a number of icons. Below the icons is some
    information about the corpus. This is the LaBB-CAT home page.
4.  Click the *where do I start?* icon on the left.\
    The help page that pops up includes a brief description of LaBB-CAT
    and some tips for navigation and getting more information.
5.  Read through the page, and then close the browser tab to return to
    the home page.

There are two main ways to use LaBB-CAT:

-   easy exploration and plain text search (this worksheet)
-   layered filtering and search (the following worksheets)

## Easy exploration

Using the 'easy' method for exploring LaBB-CAT is simple, as
annotation layers are largely ignored; each transcript is essentially
treated as a plain text that you can search and display based on
ordinary orthographic spelling.

1.  On the LaBB-CAT home page, click the *explore* icon to access the
    easy exploration pages.\
    You will see a similar home page, with *Browse* icon, *Easy Search*,
    and *Layered Search* icons.
2.  Click the *Browse* icon.\
    You will see a page that lists the collections of recordings (or
    'corpora') in the LaBB-CAT database. Each corpus contains a number
    of recordings.
3.  Click the first corpus listed.\
    You will see a page that lists the first 20 recordings in the
    corpus. The recording names are on the left, followed by some meta
    data (called 'participant attributes') about the participant in the
    recording. At the bottom is a list of pages, so you can access
    further recordings in the corpus.
4.  Click the name of the first recording.\
    You will see a page with transcript text, and the video appears in
    the top right corner of the page.
5.  Hover the mouse over the video.\
    The video pane grows larger.
6.  Press the play button.\
    As the video plays, you will see the current utterance highlighted
    in the transcript. You will also see that the current utterance
    appears as closed captions in the video. You can use the video
    controls as normal, including the *full-screen* button in the bottom
    right, to make the video occupy the whole screen.
7.  Pause the recording.
8.  Move the mouse over one of the utterances further down the
    transcript.\
    You will notice that the video pane shrinks again, and that the
    mouse pointer becomes a *play* button.
9.  Click the utterance.\
    You will see that playback starts at that utterance. Playback will
    stop when the participant finishes the utterance.
10. At the top of the page, you will see a tab button labelled
    *General*; click it.\
    You will see some meta-data about the transcript and recording.\
    LaBB-CAT attaches meta-data both to transcripts (called 'transcript
    attributes'), and also to participants ('participant attributes').
11. Below the transcript attributes is the name of the participant.
    Click their name.\
    You will see a page with the participant attributes, and a list of
    the recordings they appear in. In this case, they appear in only one
    recording; if you were to click the name of the recording, you would
    be taken back to the transcript page you've just seen.

## Basic search

1.  On the menu at the top of the page, there's a *Search* option.
    Click it.\
    You will see a search form with a "Text" search box at the top, and
    options for meta data below.
2.  In the "Text" box enter the word `quake` and press the *Search*
    button at the bottom.\
    You will see a list of hits, with the name of the transcript on the
    left and the matched word on the right, highlighted within its
    immediate context.
3.  Click the *Search again* link (or the *Search* link on the menu at
    the top)\
    You'll see that the search form remembers the last search text.
4.  Select 'Female' from the *Gender* drop-down box, leave the word
    `quake` in the "Text" box, and click *Search*.\
    This time the results are narrowed down to only female participants.
5.  Click the first result.\
    You will see the transcript page, as we saw earlier, but with each
    match from the search highlighted.

## Regular Expressions

You can also search across multiple words, and search for patterns
as well as exact spellings.

For example, let's say you want to investigate how the
pronunciation of the word 'the' changes when the following word
starts with a vowel. You can search for this pattern using the
search form:

6.  Click the *Search* option on the menu.
7.  Search for the word `the`\
    You will see that there are lots of results, including many where
    'the' is followed by a word that starts with a consonant.
8.  Go back to the *Search* page.
9.  Now search for: `the [aeiou].*`\
    This is a 'regular expression' that allows you to identify a
    pattern, with the following parts:
    -   the word 'the'
    -   followed by a space
    -   followed by any vowel (`[aeiou]`)
    -   followed anything at all - `.` in a regular expression means
        'any character', and `*` means 'zero or more of the previous
        thing', so `.*` means 'zero or more characters'\
        \
        You will see that the results include only instances where the
        word that follows 'the' starts with a vowel.
10. See if you can create a search for all words ending in 'ing'

In this worksheet you have seen that:

-   LaBB-CAT is a repository for recordings and their transcripts;
-   Transcripts are grouped together into corpora;
-   Meta-data can be attached to transcripts (transcript attributes) and
    to participants (participant attributes);
-   You can search the texts of the transcripts;
-   You can filter the search results on the basis of meta-data;
-   You can search for patterns as well as exact spelling, by using
    regular expressions.
