# 5 - Syntax

The Stanford Parser is an open-source PCFG parser that can use grammars
for a variety of languages including English.

LaBB-CAT includes a Layer Manager that handles integration with the
parser. The Stanford Parser Layer Manager:

-   extracts chunks of transcripts (ideally sentences or clauses),
-   gives them to the Stanford Parser for processing, which produces a
    'best parse' for the utterance provided, and
-   saves the parse on a 'tree' layer, and optionally saves the
    resulting part-of-speech tags on a word layer.

One of the problems with parsing speech is that speakers often don't
speak in complete, well-formed sentences. In addition, the demo corpus
you are using was not generally transcribed with parsing in mind, and so
grammatically complete units have not been marked with full-stops,
commas, etc. (Instead, full-stop has been used to mark short pauses in
speech).

For these reasons, the parses you will see in this data may not be
perfect. However, it's possible to get a sense of the kinds of things
that could be achieved with well-formed written texts, or speech that
has been transcribed with grammatical punctuation included.

1.  Click the *transcripts* link on the menu.

One transcript in the database has delimiters inserted which divide
the transcript into more or less grammatical units. As the
'full-stop' symbol is already being used to mark pauses, the
'vertical bar' symbol \| has been used as a grammatical delimiter.

The transcript is called *BR2044\_OllyOhlson.eaf*

2.  In the *Transcript* box, type *olly*.\
    After a short pause, *BR2044\_OllyOhlson.eaf* will be the only
    transcript in the filtered list.
3.  Click *BR2044\_OllyOhlson.eaf*
4.  Untick all except the *word* layer, to avoid clutter.
5.  When the transcript re-loads, tick the *syntax* project.\
    This reveals three layers.
6.  Tick the *parseable* layer.

When the transcript re-loads, you will see that almost all words in the
transcript have been tagged with their own orthography. However, some
words have not been tagged:

-   filled pauses like "um", "ah , etc. and
-   incomplete words like "re~", "na\~", etc. - i.e. cases where the
    participant started saying something but changed their mind.

These have been identified by the Pattern Matcher Layer Manager, which
can pick out words by regular expression, and has been configured to tag
as 'parseable' all tokens *except* those that matching the following
patterns:

-   *a+h+* - e.g. "ah", "aah", "ahh", ...
-   *m+h\*m+* - e.g. "mm", "mmm", "mhmm", ...
-   *e+r+* - e.g. "er", "err", "eeerr", ...
-   *u+m+* - e.g. "um", "uum", "ummm", ...
-   *.+\~* - e.g. "re\~", "na\~", "w\~", \...

The result is that the *parseable* layer includes all words except
filled pauses and incomplete words. This is the layer that is passed to
the Stanford Parser for syntactic parsing.

One of the results of parsing is that each word token is tagged with its
part-of-speech.

7.  Untick the *parseable* layer and tick the *pos* layer.\
    You will see that most of the words have been tagged with a
    syntactic category:
    -   "CC" Coordinating conjunction
    -   "DT" Determiner
    -   "JJ" Adjective
    -   "NN" Noun
    -   "NNS" Plural noun
    -   "NNP" Proper noun
    -   "PRP" Personal pronoun
    -   "PRP\$" Possessive pronoun
    -   "VB" Verb
    -   "VBD" Past tense verb
    -   "VBG" Gerund
    -   "VBZ" 3rd person singular present verb
    -   ...etc.

These, like any other word tags you have seen, can be included
in searches or exported to CSV results files.

<!--
You may notice that, in addition to the filled pauses and
interrupted words, there are some other lines that have no
part-of-speech tags. These are utterances in te reo Māori; these
utterances have been manually marked as in a different
language - if you tick the *language* layer, you can see the
language annotation. The Stanford Parser Manager has been
configure to parse only English utterances, so the Te reo Māori
ones are skipped.
-->

The other result from parsing is, of course, a 'parse tree' of
each utterance.

8.  Untick the *pos* layer <!-- (and the *language* layer if it's ticked) -->
    and tick the *parse* layer.\
    You will see that above the words, there are bracketing annotations
    that are labelled with parts-of-speech or phrase labels.\
    Each of these brackets represents a syntactic constituent
    constructed by the parser, smaller constituents at the bottom,
    building into larger constituents going up.
3.  Click on any constituent label (e.g. "NP" or "S").\
    A new window will open, which shows the selected utterance, using
    the familiar 'upside-down tree' representation.\
    If the tree appears far off and small, you can make it larger by
    widening the window, or 'zooming in' with you mouse wheel.\
    \
    You can also search the parses themselves.
4.  Close the parse tree window.
5.  Click the *search* option on the menu.
6.  Tick the *syntax* project.
7.  Tick the *parse* and *pos* layers.

On the *parse* layer you'll see that you can enter a search
expression for annotations on that layer, just like any other.

However, it also has a checkbox before and after the pattern. If you
tick the checkbox before the pattern, it will anchor the search to
the first word in the matching constituent. Similarly the checkbox
after the pattern anchors to the last word in the constituent.

Let's say you want all the noun phrases that *don't* start with a
determiner like "the", "this", "a", etc.

14.  Enter a pattern that matches *NP* (noun phrase) on the *parse*
    layer...
9.  \...and tick the checkbox to anchor to the first word in the
    consituent.
10. Enter a pattern that would match *DT* (determiner) on the *pos*
    layer...
11. \...and in the dropdown box before the pattern, select *doesn't
    match*.

This will match words who have an annotation that doesn't match
"DT" on the \*pos\* layer.

12. Press *Search*.

When the search finishes, you should see that lots of nouns are
returned, but nothing preceded by "the", "a", "that", or any other
determiner.

In this worksheet you have seen that:

-   the Stanford Parser can we used to annotate transcripts with
    part-of-speech tags and constituent annotations, and
-   the resulting annotations can be included in syntax-based searches.
