## 1. Installation

In this exercise you will install the LaBB-CAT software. 

::: {.callout-note}

You should only follow these steps if you will be running LaBB-CAT on your own computer.

If you are using a LaBB-CAT server that's already been installed for you elsewhere, you can skip with exercise.

:::

After this you will have an empty LaBB-CAT database set up ready to set up.

1.  You have a file called *install-labbcat.jar* - double click this file to start the installer.\
    If you are using OS X, you may see a message that the file can't be opened:\
    ![](install-labbcat-OSX-warning.png) \
    If this happens:
    1.  Click the Apple icon in the top left corner of the screen.
    2.  Select *System Preferences*
    3.  Click *Security & Privacy*\
        Near the bottom it says "*install-labbcat.jar'' was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer.*\
        ![](install-labbcat-OSX-open-anyway.png)
    4.  Click *Open Anyway*\
        You may see another warning about the program being downloaded from the internet\
        ![](install-labbcat-OSX-open.png)
    5.  Click *Open*\
        \
        ![](install-labbcat.png)
2.  Click *Start*\
    You will see the progress bar move as files are installed. Once this is finished, you'll see a message saying *Installation complete*.
3.  Click *Finished* to close the installer.

The software is now installed. LaBB-CAT is a browser-based system, which means that it works as a mini web server on your computer, and you need to access it using your web browser.

Each time you want to use LaBB-CAT, you must start it up, and which you've finished, you close it down again.

To start LaBB-CAT, click the LaBB-CAT icon in your applications area.

-   On Windows, open the *Start* menu and type LaBB-CAT.
-   On OS X you will find LaBB-CAT in your *Applications* folder.

A window called "LaBB-CAT Server" will open, and after a short delay, your default web browser will open on a page called "LaBB-CAT" (The first time only, this page will initially display the LaBB-CAT licence).

Now that the software is installed, we will set up a basic structure for receiving data, in the following exercise.
