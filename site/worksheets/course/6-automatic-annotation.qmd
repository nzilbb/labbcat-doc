# 6. Automatic Annotation

You can configure LaBB-CAT to automatically generate annotations, using
'layer managers'. Basically, layer managers are automatic annotation
modules that take data in one annotation layer, do some kind of
computation on it, and save the result to another annotation layer.

In this exercise, we will use the following layer managers:

-   *Frequency Layer Manager*, which counts tokens of each word type,
    over a configurable scope.
-   *Porter Stemmer*, which applies the Porter algorithm to word
    orthographies to compute word stems.
-   *Pattern Matcher*, which creates annotations based on matching
    regular expressions against words.
-   *Statistics Layer Manager*, which computes aggregated information,
    like word count or duration, over groups of words.

LaBB-CAT comes with number of layer managers pre-installed; you can see
a list of installed layer managers by clicking the *layer managers* menu
option. Other layer managers have to be manually installed.

---

For this exercise, we'll pretend we've got a couple more
mini-research projects:

-   we're interested in looking at how rare or common words are in our data, and
-   we want to study 'filled pauses' like "um", "ah", etc.

## Frequency

To start with, we'll simply annotate each word token in the database
with the count of how many times that word appears in the database\...

(@)  First of all, create a new project called *frequency*, using the steps we saw before.
(@) Select the *word layers* menu option.\
    You will see a list of word layers (including the 'custom' layer for
    the "the" project we created earlier).
(@) Add a new layer, with the following settings:
    -   **Layer ID:** `frequency`
    -   **Type:** *Number*
    -   **Alignment:** *None*
    -   **Manager:** *Frequency Layer Manager*
    -   **Generate:** *Always*
    -   **Project:** *frequency*
    -   **Description:** `Count of tokens of the same type within each corpus`
        \
        Press the *New* button
(@) You will see the layer configuration form. Fill it in with the following details:
    -   **Summary:** *Raw Count*
    -   **Layer to summarize:** *orthography*
    -   **Scope of Summary:** *Corpus* (leave the box next to that with
        the *[each corpus]* option selected)
    -   **Main participants only:** ticked
    -   **Participants:** un-ticked
    -   **Filter Layer:** un-ticked
    -   **Word pairs:** un-ticked
    -   **Pause Markers:** [leave this blank]
    -   **Transcript types:** un-tick *wordlist* (as counting word list
        tokens would artificially inflate frequencies of those words)
    -   **Annotate tokens:** ticked

:::{.callout-note}
![](help.png) If you want more information about what these options mean, check the online help page.
:::

(@) Press *Save*\
    You will see a message asking you if you want generate the layer
    data now.
(@) Press *Regenerate*.\
    You will see a progress bar moving across the page while the counts
    are being generated. When it is finished, you will see a message
    saying "Layer complete..."

Now each word in each transcript is annotated with the count of the
number of instances of that word with the corpus of the transcript.

To see what that looks like...

(@) Select the *transcripts* menu option.
(@) Select the name of the first transcript in the list.
(@) At the top of the transcript there is now a list of projects. Tick
    the "frequency" project.\
    This will reveal the frequency layer in the list of layers.
(@) Tick the *frequency* layer.\
    When the transcript reloads, you will see that above each word is a
    number. That number is the number of times that word appears in the
    transcript's corpus.\
    e.g. if the word "and" has 669 above it, and the transcript is in
    the *QB* corpus, that means that the word "and" appears in the *QB*
    corpus 669 times.

The newly-generated annotations are also searchable...

(@) Select the *search* menu option.
(@) If the *frequency* project and layer are not already ticked, tick
    them to add the *frequency* layer to the search matrix.\
    \
    In the search matrix, you will notice that, unlike the *orthography*
    layer, which has one box for a regular expression, the *frequency*
    layer has two boxes, marked "≥" and "<". For a layer of type
    *Number* (which is what you specified above), instead of a regular
    expression, you can match by numeric range.
(@) We want all the words that appeared only once in their corpus. Enter
    a number or numbers in the appropriate box (you can leave either box
    blank) and press *Search*.
(@) Press *▼ 20 More Matches* a couple of times, to get a good idea of
    the range of results.

The results you see may contain words that don't seem rare at all.
That they only appear once is a product of two factors:

i) there isn't that much data in our example database, and\
ii) these are counts of 'wordforms' - i.e. the surface spelling of
    the word; e.g. the word "damaging" might be quite rare, even though
    there are more instances of words from the same stem like "damage",
    and "damaged". This second factor will be addressed soon...

You can also extract the annotations into CSV results from other searches...

(@) On the search page, do a search for "the" followed by a word that
    starts with a vowel.
(@) When the results page appears, click the ▼ button next to the *CSV Export* button.
(@) Under the list of *Word* layers, tick the *frequency* layer.
(@) Click the *CSV Export* button.
(@) Save and open the resulting CSV file.\
    You will notice that in the spreadsheet there are two columns:
    -   *Match frequency:* this lists the frequency of each word that
        matched, in order. i.e. in this case two numbers, the frequency
        of "the", followed by the frequency of the word after it.
    -   *Target frequency:* this contains a single frequency, in this
        case the frequency of the first word that matched a pattern -
        i.e. "the"
(@) As an aside, you can also select other layers to include in the CSV
    file. For example, some of the transcripts include topic-tags that
    were made in the original ELAN transcript.\
    Export your search results to CSV again, this time including the
    *topic* layer, and see what that looks like.\

The Frequency Layer Manager also keeps a word-list with token counts for each corpus...

(@) Click the *layer managers* menu option.
(@) On the "Frequency Layer Manager" row, click the *Extensions* button.
(@) You will see a drop-down box with each corpus in it.\
    Select *QB* and click *Export*.
(@) Save and open the resulting CSV file.\
    You will see an alphabetical list of all the distinct word types in
    the QB corpus, and next to each, a count of the number of tokens of
    that type in the QB corpus.

## Porter Stemmer

As pointed out above, although the 'wordform' counts might be
useful, it also may be useful to lump together different forms of
the same stem for the counts. e.g. if there's 1 "damaging" token,
28 "damage" token, and 18 "damaged" token, it may be useful to count
these all together as 47 tokens of the same stem.

In order to achieve this, we first need to 'stem' all the words in
the database - i.e. reduce all the wordforms so that tokens like
"damaging", "damage", "damaged", and "damages" all have the same
'stem' annotation. Then we can gather frequency statistics on the
stems.

The *Porter Stemmer Layer Manager* is one way to achieve this.
First, we need to install this layer manager (which only works on
English data, so it's not installed by default).
  
(@) Select the *layer managers* menu option.
(@) Near the bottom of the page, select the *List of layer managers that
    are not yet installed* link.
(@) Find the "Porter Stemmer" in the list, and press its *Install*
    button, and then *Install* again to continue.
(@) After it is installed, a tab appears with some information about
    what the layer manager does. You may wish to read this page for your
    information. Afterwards, you can close the tab to take you back to
    the LaBB-CAT browser tab.
(@) Select the *word layers* menu option.
(@) Add a new layer with the following attributes:
    -   **Layer ID:** `stem`
    -   **Type:** *Text*
    -   **Alignment:** *None*
    -   **Manager:** *Porter Stemmer*
    -   **Generate:** *Always*
    -   **Project:** *frequency*
    -   **Description:** `The stem of the word according to the Porter algorithm`\
        \
        Click the *New* button.
(@) The Porter Stemmer's default configuration is fine for our
    purposes, so press *Set Parameters*.
(@) Press *Regenerate*.\
    You will see a progress bar, and once it's finished, you will see a
    message saying "Layer complete..."
(@) Select the *transcripts* menu option.
(@) Click the name of the first transcript.
(@) Tick the *stem* layer we just added.\
    When the transcript refreshes, you will see, above each word, its
    'stem' according to the Porter algorithm.

You will notice that, although the stems are not what you might
regard as being the 'lemma' of each word (i.e. not necessarily
valid words of English in themselves), they nevertheless generally
strip off plural and 3rd-person-present suffixes, such that
different wordforms of the same lemma will have the same 'stem'.

Now that we have generated a layer of 'stems' for the wordforms on
the *orthography* layer, we can generate frequency data from the
*stem* layer as well...

(@) Click the *word layers* menu option.
(@) Add a new layer with the following attributes:
    -   **Layer ID:** `stemFrequency`
    -   **Type:** *Number*
    -   **Alignment:** *None*
    -   **Manager:** *Frequency Layer Manager*
    -   **Project:** *frequency*
    -   **Description:** `Count of tokens of the same stem within each corpus`\
        \
        Press the *New* button.
(@) Configure the layer exactly as before, except this time, set the
    **Layer to summarize:** setting to the *stem* layer we created
    above. *Save* your settings and press *Regenerate*.\
    The layer will be generated.
(@) Do a search of all speakers, for words with a value of 1 on your new
    *stemFrequency* layer.\
    You should notice that the variety of words returned seem a little
    'rarer' that those returned previously when you were searching the
    wordform *frequency* layer.

## Pattern Matcher

We will now create some automatic annotations of a different kind.
Let's suppose that we're interested in 'filled pauses' -- words
like "um", "ah", "er", "mmm", etc. You can actually identify them
using regular expressions...

(@) Do a search of all speakers, for the word `ah`. Select the *no
    matches, only a summary of results* option.\
    Note the number of results you get back.
(@) Now do a similar search, for the pattern: `a+h+` i.e. 1 or more
    *a*'s followed by one or more *h*'s.\
    Note the number of result you get back is more than in the previous
    search. It turns out the transcribers, when transcribing the word
    "ah" weren't entirely consistent in their spelling of that word.
    That's ok, because with a little imagination, we can invent
    searches that will identify filled pauses like "um", "ah", and "mm",
    even if they've been spelt "umm", "ahh", or "mmm".\
    (It turns out that there's a good reason to prefer "mmm" over "mm",
    but we'll see that in a later exercise)
(@) Try out a few different searches to see if you can identify
    different ways that transcribers have spelt filled pauses like
    this.

We could annotate these as filled pauses by searching, annotating a
CSV file, and uploading the CSV annotations, as we did previously.
However, there is a layer manager that can do this for us, for all
the existing data, and for any new transcripts that might be
uploaded in the future: the "Pattern Matcher" layer manager.

(@) First of all, create a new project called *pauses*.
(@) Now create a new word layer, with the following attributes:
    -   **Layer ID:** `pause`
    -   **Type:** *Text*
    -   **Alignment:** *None*
    -   **Manager:** *Pattern Matcher*
    -   **Generate:** *Always*
    -   **Project:** *pauses*
    -   **Description:** `Filled pauses annotated by regular expression`\
        \
        Press the *New* button
(@) Set the **Source Layer** to be *orthography*.\
    The **Destination Layer** and language-related settings can be left
    with their default values.
    
Below this, there is a currently empty list of "Mappings". We are
going to add regular expressions to this list, which will identify
filled pauses.

(@) On the new empty row that's already in the list by default, click
    on the box labelled "Source pattern", and enter: `u+m+`
(@) To the right of this, click in the "Destination Label" box and
    enter: *um*\
    This will make the layer manager find any instances of words that
    match the pattern "*u+m+"* on the *orthography* layer, and in each
    case, save the annotation "um" on our new *pause* layer.
(@) Press the + button to add a new blank row, and add another regular
    expression:
    -   **Source Pattern:** `a+h+`
    -   **Destination Label:** `ah`
(@) Press the + button again, and add another regular expression:
    -   **Source Pattern:** `mm+`
    -   **Destination Label:** `mm`
(@) Add any more regular expressions you think might help identify
    filled pauses.
(@) Under the patterns, select the option to *Delete annotations in
    target layer whose source matches no pattern*

:::{.callout-tip}
ⓘ If you would like more information about the pattern configuration
and what kinds of target annotations you can create, you will find
that clicking on the brief description of the layer manager above
the form expands to provide more detail.
:::

(@) Press *Set Parameters* and *Regenerate* to generate the layer.\
    You will see a progress bar while the layer manager annotates all
    the filled pauses in the database.
(@) To see what this looks like in a transcript, perform a search for
    *um* on your new *pause* layer, and click on the first match.\
    You should see that each instance of the word "um" (or its variants)
    has been annotated, as have instances of "ah" and "mm".

Now that these filled pauses are automatically annotated, there are
various things you might do with the annotations. You could:

- include them in the context of multi-word searches, for example
you might want to study the effects of a filled pause on the
following or preceding word, or
- search for only the pauses themselves, for selected speakers, in
order to study what kinds of filled pauses are used by which
speakers in what contexts, what their durations are, etc.

## Statistics Layer Manager

In fact, we can use another layer manager to automatically count
them for each speaker, and for each utterance in the transcript. In
order to do this, we are going to create a 'phrase layer', which is
a layer that can contain annotations over groups of words (as
opposed to against individual words). The layer manager we will use
can also annotate participants...

(@) Click the *phrase layers* option on the menu.\
    You will see a list of phrase layers that are already set up,
    including *language* and (named) *entity*.
(@) Add a new layer with the following characteristics:
    -   **Layer ID:** `pauseCount`
    -   **Type:** *Number*
    -   **Alignment:** *Intervals*
    -   **Manager:** *Statistics Layer Manager*
    -   **Generate:** *Always*
    -   **Project:** *pauses*
    -   **Description:** `Count of filled pauses, for the utterance and the speaker`\
        \
        Click *New*
(@) You will see a form for the layer's configuration. Fill in the
    details as follows:
    -   **Layer to summarize:** *pause*
    -   **Statistic:** *Token Count*
    -   **Pattern to match:** [leave this blank]
    -   **Context:** [leave this blank]
    -   **Pause Threshold:** [leave this blank]
    -   **Main-participant utterances only:** ticked
    -   **Scopes:** tick *Utterances*, and under *Participants:*, select
        the option *add new attribute called pauseCount*
    -   **Transcript types:** leave all the options ticked

:::{.callout-tip}
![](help.png) If you would like more information about what
these settings and the other options do, try the online help for
this page.
:::

(@) *Save* the layer configuration, and then press *Regenerate*.\
    You will see a progress bar while the layer manager annotates all
    the transcripts in the database.
(@) To see what this looks like in the transcripts, select the
    *transcripts* option on the menu and open the first transcript in
    the list.
(@) Under the list of projects, if the *pauses* project isn't already
    ticked, tick it, which will reveal the *pauseCount* layer in the
    list of layers.
(@) Tick the *pauseCount* layer.\
    Scrolling down the transcript, you will see that, wherever there is
    a filled pause like "um", the entire utterance in which it appears
    has a bracket across the top of the words, labelled with the number
    of filled-pauses that occurs in that utterance.
(@) Scroll to the top of the transcript, and click on the name of the
    main participant.\
    You will see the participant's attributes page, which now includes
    the participant's *pauseCount* attribute.
(@) Both the local utterance count, and the participant's overall
    count, can also be exported to CSV search results files.\
    Select *search* and perform a search involving the *pause* layer.
(@) At the bottom of the results page, click the ▼ button next to the
    *CSV Export* button, to reveal the layer options.
(@) Under *Participant* layers tick the *pauseCount* attribute.
(@) Under *Phrase* layers tick the *pauseCount* layer.
(@) Press *CSV Export*, and save and open the resulting file.\
    You will notice that there is a column called
    "participant_pauseCount" with the participant's global count, and
    another called "Target pauseCount" with the local utterance count.

The Statistics Layer Manager can also incorporate time information in
its computation, so it can be used to compute speech-rate. We could use
it on our example database to compute words-per-minute for utterances,
turns, speakers, etc.

If you like, you can try to figure out how to set up a "words-per-minute" layer now.

However, normally speech-rate is expressed in syllables per minute. We
don't have any way to get syllable-counts for our words yet, but we
will be doing that in a later exercise\...

In this exercise, you've seen how layer managers can be used to compute
new annotations automatically from existing annotations, e.g.

-   Words can be tagged with their frequency in the LaBB-CAT database,
    or its corpora.
-   Words can be tagged with their 'stem' using the Porter Stemmer.
-   Words can be tagged with annotations on the basis of regular
    expressions.
-   Groups of words can be tagged with aggregated information like word
    count or rate over time.
