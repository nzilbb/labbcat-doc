# 8a. HTK

The Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) is a speech recognition toolkit
developed at Cambridge University. It is a set of programs that can be
used to build speech recognition systems. Part of the process of
building such systems involves force-aligning training data - i.e.
automatically lining up phonemic-transcriptions of known words with the
audio signal in the training recordings. LaBB-CAT takes advantage of
this capability to facilitate forced-alignment for your transcripts.

In order to do this, HTK needs the following ingredients:

1.  a set of recordings broken up into short utterances,
2.  orthographic transcriptions of each utterance, and
3.  phonemic transcriptions of each of the words in each utterance

You already have 1. and 2. - i.e. a set of recordings with transcripts
that include the start and end times of each line.

You also mostly have 3. as well, if you have done a previous exercise
which included generating a pronunciation layer generated using a
lexicon like CELEX or the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary. However, there
are words in your transcripts that aren't in CELEX, and so we will
explore some mechanisms for filling in their pronunciations.

In this exercise you will

-   install the HTK Layer Manager,
-   provide some pronunciations that are missing,
-   force-align the speech of one of the participants in your database,
    and
-   check and manually correct the alignments.

In this exercise, you will set up Praat Integration in your web
browser. There is currently no Praat integration support for
Microsoft's Edge' browser, so if you normally use 'Edge' on Windows,
you may need to swap to another browser for this exercise - e.g.
*Google Chrome*, or *Mozilla Firefox*.
:::

## Installation

HTK is not free software in the "GNU" sense - i.e. we can not distribute
it with LaBB-CAT, instead you have to download it yourself from the
Cambridge University website -- however it is free in the "no cost"
sense, you just need to register on the HTK website, and you can then
download and use HTK free of charge.

(@) Register at <http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/register.shtml>
(@) Download the version of HTK that is appropriate for the computer
    that LaBB-CAT is installed on:
    -   For Windows systems, there are pre-compiled .exe files that you
        can download.
    -   For Unix-like systems including OS X, you need to download the
        source code, which you will then install following the provided
        instructions.
(@) Unzip (for Windows) or compile and install (for Unix-like systems)
    the downloaded files on the computer that LaBB-CAT is installed on.

:::{.callout-note}

If your LaBB-CAT server is installed in a *Docker Container*, LaBB-CAT
can itself download and compile HTK (i.e. steps 2 and 3), as long has
you have a username and password for the HTK website. In this case,
these steps are automatically attempted when you install the HTK layer
manager (below).

:::

Now, you have to install the HTK Layer Manager, which is the LaBB-CAT
module that provides HTK with all the data it needs, and then saves to
alignments HTK produces back to your database.

(@) Select the *layer managers* menu option.
(@) Follow the *List of layer managers that are not yet installed* link at the bottom.
(@) Find HTK Manager in the list, and press its *Install* button, then
    press *Install* again.\
    You will see a form with boxes that may already be filled in.
(@) The layer manager needs to know where the HTK programs have been
    saved, which is what you need to enter in the blank *Path to HTK tools* box.\
    If this box is not blank, it means that LaBB-CAT has already found
    HTK for you, so you should leave the default value already set.

::: {.callout-note}
The other two boxes you may see are for the username and password you
registered on the HTK website. On some systems, if you have not
already installed the HTK tools on your LaBB-CAT computer, providing
the username and password allows LaBB-CAT to attempt to download and
install HTK itself. This may not work in all cases, as LaBB-CAT may
not have the resources or privileges it requires to compile or
install software.
:::

(@) Press *Configure*.\
    You will see a window open with some information about the HTK Layer
    Manager. 
(@) Now you need to add a *phrase layer* for the HTK configuration:
    -   **Layer ID:** `htk`
    -   **Type:** *Text*
    -   **Alignment:** *Intervals*
    -   **Manager:** *HTK Manager*
    -   **Generate:** *Never* (note that this may see counter-intuitive,
        but we will be running HTK manually rather than allowing it to
        run automatically when transcripts are uploaded.)
    -   **Description:** `HTK alignment time`
(@) When you configure the layer:
    -   Your *Pronunciation Layer* will be the *phonemes* layer you
        created in an earlier exercise.
    -   To the list of *Pause Markers* you should add a full-stop
        (period).\
        This is because the exercise transcripts use `.` as a
        'short-pause' marker, not an 'end of sentence' marker. i.e.
        your Pause Markers should be:\
        `- .`\
        (a hyphen, then a space, then a full-stop/period)
    -   The rest of the settings should be left with the default
        values.\

:::{.callout-tip}
If you're curious about what the configuration options do,
hover your mouse over each option to see a 'tool tip' that
describes what the option is for.
:::

We configure the layer to 'never' generate, because we're
going to trigger forced-alignments manually, one speaker at a
time, once we're happy that the phonemic transcriptions are in
place.

## Missing Pronunciations

Now we're going to check the situation of our pronunciations on
the phonemes layer more carefully...

(@) Go to the *transcripts* page and open the transcript *UC207YW*
(@) Tick the *phonemes* layer.
(@) Have a look through the transcript to see where the missing phonemic
    transcriptions are.

You'll see they divide into various broad types:

-   Typos like "Febuary"
-   Specialist or invented words like "tarseal"
-   Contractions like "me's" and "thing's"
-   Proper names like "Bealey"
-   Possibly filled pauses like "um"
-   Hesitations and interrupted words like "exac\~", etc.\

HTK needs a phonemic transcription for every word on a line in
order to force-align that line. So every line where there's a
gap on the phonemes layer would be ignored by the HTK layer
manager.

(@) There's another problem in this transcript, which isn't
    necessarily immediately obvious.\
    Look for the hesitiation "w-" and the filled-pause "mm" to see
    if you can see what it is.

'False positives' from the lexicon will also play havoc with forced
alignment, as HTK believes what it's told about the pronunciations
given to it, and will do it's best to find an alignment that
includes every phoneme.\

Each of these problems needs to be addressed before we do forced
alignment, although the solution for each will vary. Some involve
improving the transcript, others will involve adding new words to
our dictionary.

-   For false-positives like "w-" and "mm", the easiest solution is
to transcribe these differently. Hesitations like "w-" are
discussed below. We will use "mmm" instead of "mm".
-   For very short false-starts like "w-", the CELEX layer manager
has been built to give a helping hand. In addition to looking up
phonemic transcriptions in CELEX, it will also compute them for
very short tagged false-starts. The tag it recognizes is a
trailing tilde \~, so we need to change "w-" to "w\~" etc. Then
the CELEX layer manager will append a schwa to the initial
consonant, and save that as the pronunciation (i.e. /É™/).
-   For invented or misspoken words, or longer interrupted words,
which we're not likely to see again in any other transcript
like, "me's" and "exac\~", we will add a 'pronounce' tag in the
transcript, which includes the correct pronunciation. Again, the
CELEX layer manager knows to check for pronounce annotations,
and uses the given phonemic transcription instead of looking up
the CELEX data.
-   For proper names and contractions like "thing's" that we're
likely to see over and over again in different transcripts,
instead of tagging each one individually, we will add them to
the dictionary of pronunciations that the lexicon layer manager
looks up.

As you can see, the first three methods involve editing the
transcript. This can be done by editing the original file in
ELAN, and then re-uploading it into the database for
processing.

Alternatively, LaBB-CAT has a mechanism for editing the
transcript 'in-situ'; this doesn't update the original file,
but it's sometimes much more convenient, and this is the method
we'll use for this exercise.

(@) Click on the word "Febuary", and select the *Edit Transcript* option
    from the menu.\
    A window will open that allows you to edit that line in the
    transcript.
(@) Correct the spelling of the word to be "February"
(@) Press *Update*
(@) Press *Close*
(@) Similarly change "w-" to be "w~" and "mm" to be "mmm"
(@) Click on the word "me's", and select the *Edit Transcript* option
    from the menu.\
    It seems unlikely that anyone else will say "me's", so instead of
    adding it to the lexicon, we're simply going to tag this token with
    a *pronounce* tag. This is achieved by adding the pronunciation we
    want to tag it with in square brackets, using the DISC phoneme
    symbols. We have to add the *pronounce* tag immediately after the
    word, with no intervening space. (This transcription convention also
    works if you edit the original transcript in ELAN)
(@) Change the line text from "\...bit of me's a bit ..." to be "...bit
    of me's[miz] a bit ..." instead.
(@) Click *Update* and then *Close*\
    The *pronounce* annotation you've just added isn't displayed in
    the transcript. It's added to the *pronounce* layer, which is for
    this type of manual pronunciation tagging.
(@) Scroll to the top of the transcript and tick the *pronounce* layer
    so that it will be displayed.\
    When the transcript is reloaded, you will be able to see "miz" as an
    annotation on "me's", and that this has been copied into the
    *phonemes* layer by its layer manager.
(@) Similarly you should tag the word "exac~" with the pronunciation
    `Igz{k`

This method takes care of instances where the transcript is
incorrect, and 'one off' missing pronunciations. However, for
missing words that are likely to appear over and again in the
corpus, including names like "Bealey", "Wainoni", and "Lyttleton",
and filled pauses like "mmm", "um", etc. it's not efficient to tag
every token. Instead, we add these to the lexicon.

(@) Select the *participants* menu option.
(@) Find *UC207YW* in the list, and click on their name.
(@) Click the *All Utterances* link below their attributes.
(@) Leave the default selections and press *List*.\
    This displays a page with a list of all the speaker's utterances,
    from which you can do various things with all the utterances of a
    particular participant in the database.
(@) Press the *Htk* button.\
    You will see a progress bar while LaBB-CAT identifies missing words.
    Then a page will appear that lists unknown words.
(@) Basically you need to fill in the boxes with the pronunciations and click *Save Pronunciations*.

{{< pagebreak >}}

::: {.callout-note}

-   You don't have to fill them all in at once, you can do a few,
and click *Save*, which will save your work and list what's
left.
-   You don't have to fill them all in, you can leave some empty 
and continue with the HTK forced-alignment by clicking *Start*
(HTK will ignore any lines where the remaining unknown words
appear, but the ones you filled in will be included).
-   Some of the boxes will be initially filled in with a suggestion
from the lexicon layer manager - these may or may not be
correct, and aren't saved until you save them.
-   The pronunciations have to be in the 'DISC' format - i.e. one
character per phoneme, with no spaces. There's a 'helper' link
on the right of each pronunciation box - if you click it, it
expands into a list of clickable phonemes - just the ones that
aren't ordinary letters, and diphthongs etc.
-   The *search* button lets you look up the lexicon for similar
words - this probably won't help for place names, but for words
like "tarseal", you can click the *lookup* button, enter "tar
seal" in the box as two separate words, and you'll get back the
DISC pronunciation of each word, with clickable buttons to copy
the given pronunciation into the box. This is useful for digits
and numbers too, which may not be in the lexicon - so for "1",
search for "one" and copy the pronunciation.
-   If you click on the word itself, the transcript for the first
instance of that word is opened, in case you want to listen to
it, or in case it's actually just a typo and you want to
correct the transcript.
-   If you're using CELEX, when you specify the pronunciations,
it's recommended to put syllable separators (-) and primary
stress markers (') too - e.g. for "tarseal" you can put
*t\#sil* but it would actually be better to put *t\#-'sil*.
These markers are entered into the dictionary even though
they're stripped out for HTK, and they may come in handy later
(e.g. the syllable separators are used by the CELEX layer
manager to count syllables).
:::

When you add pronunciations this way, they're added to the
dictionary and all the instances of those words in LaBB-CAT are
updated with the pronunciations - not just the participant
you're looking at, but all participants in the database. So you
only have to come up with a pronunciation for each word once.

## Alignment

(@) Once you've filled in all the missing pronunciations, forced
    alignment will start automatically. If you want to start forced
    alignment before you've entered all pronunciations, click the
    *Start* button at the bottom of the page.\
    \
    You should see a progress bar while the forced alignment is running.
    It will take a few minutes to complete.

Once HTK has produced the word and segment alignments, it:

-   sets the start/end times of the words on the transcript layer
    accordingly,
-   adds new phone annotations to the *segments* layer with the
    alignments of the phones, and
-   saves a timestamp in the *htk* layer.

When the layer manager has finished, you'll see a message saying
"Complete - words and phones from selected utterances are now
aligned."

## Inspection/Correction

You can inspect/correct alignments using LaBB-CAT's integration with Praat.

(@) Go back to the *UC207YW.eaf* transcript.
(@) Tick both the *htk* layer and the *segments* layer.\
    You will see which lines have been force-aligned, as they have an
    HTK timestamp, and have the *segments* layer filled in. If it has
    missed some lines, this is most likely because there is an unknown
    word, another speaker speaking at the same time, or possibly HTK
    simply failed to align the line (there are various reasons this
    happens, including not enough data for training, noisy recordings,
    inaccurate transcription, etc.).

The interactive transcript page doesn't show you the alignments of
the words or phones, but you can see those using Praat. You can open
individual utterances in Praat directly from the transcript page,
but first, the LaBB-CAT/Praat integration has to be set up; this
only has to be done once:

i.  On the top-right of the page, above the playback controls, there's
    a Praat icon Â - click it.
ii. Follow the instructions that appear (these vary depending on what
    web browser you use).\
    You may be asked whether to allow the "LaBB-CAT Integration Applet"
    to run. If you tick the "Do not show this again" option, then this
    message will not appear every time you open a transcript.\
    You may need to grant a browser extension permission to install, and
    it's possible you will need a connection to the internet in order
    to download this extension.\
    You also may be asked where Praat is installed; Navigate to the
    location where Praat is installed, and double-click the "Praat.exe"
    file (on some systems the file may simply be called "Praat"). The
    Praat program may open, and then immediately close, as LaBB-CAT
    tests it can communicate with Praat.

Now Praat integration has been set up, and you should be able to
access Praat options in the transcript page from now on...

(@) Click on a line that has been aligned, and select the *Open TextGrid* option on the menu.\
    You may be asked you if want to allow access to the "LaBB-CAT
    Integration Applet" - if so, tick "Do not show this again", and
    click *Allow*.

Praat should open, and show you a spectrogram of the line's audio,
with a TextGrid below that includes the words and the segments.

(@) If you click on a word, and hit the {{< kbd tab >}} key, the word's
    interval is played. Try out various words, and see what you think
    about how accurate HTK has been with its alignment.\
    Try this out with different lines in the transcript.\
    You will see that in some cases the alignment is pretty good, and in
    other cases, it's not so good. In the not-so-good cases, see if you
    can figure out why HTK got it wrong.

You may have noticed that, each time you open an utterance in Praat,
a button appears in the transcript to the left of the line, labelled
*Import Changes*. This button allows you to save any adjustments you
might want to make to the alignments back into the LaBB-CAT
database.

(@) If you feel confident using Praat, open an utterance TextGrid,
    adjust the alignments of the words an phones so that they're more
    accurate, and then click the *Import Changes* button in the
    transcript.

:::{.callout-warning}
These changes are flagged as manual edits, so if forced-alignment is
run again, they will not be over-written with new bad alignments.
Therefore it's important that the changes you make are actually
improvements, because HTK will never change them again.
:::

:::{.callout-important}

There are some rules about what you can change:

-   You're not allowed to add or delete words (if this is
    necessary, it should be done by correcting the transcript
    instead).
-   All the phones must be within the bounds of their own word.
-   The start of the first phone should line up with the start of
    the word, and the end of the last phone should line up with the
    end of the word.
-   You should not change the alignment of the utterance itself
    (which would only be possible if you select the *Open Text Grid
    incl. Â± 1 utterance in Praat* option).
:::

In this exercise, you have seen how HTK can be used to compute word and
phone alignments automatically from your data, but that there is a fair
amount of careful transcription, tagging, and dictionary filling
required. Even after all that work, perfect automatic alignments are not
guaranteed, but LaBB-CAT has a mechanism for manually correcting poor
alignments.

All this manual annotation and correction means a lot of work, but
obviously somewhat less work than would be involved in aligning by hand
the transcripts from scratch!
