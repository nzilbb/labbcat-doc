# 8b. MFA

The Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) is a 3rd-party tool developed by
Michael McAuliffe and others that can use words with phonemic
transcriptions, and the corresponding audio, to force-align words and
phones; i.e. determine the start and end time of each speech sound
within each word, and thus the start/end times of the words.

The annotator can work in two modes:

-   *Train and Align* - acoustic models are trained on the data you want
    to align, which can be in any language as long as you have a
    pronunciation dictionary for it.
-   *Pre-trained Models/Dictionaries* - pre-trained models and
    pronunciation dictionaries are supplied by the Montreal Forced
    Aligner and used for forced alignment. Languages for which
    dictionaries are available include:
    -   English
    -   French
    -   German
    -   Brazilian Portuguese
    -   Spanish
    -   Catalan

As the data we have is in English, we will use the *Pre-trained
Models/Dictionaries* approach in this exercise.

In this exercise you will

-   install the MFA Layer Manager,
-   force-align the speech of all of the participants in your database,
    and
-   check and manually correct the alignments.

:::{.callout-important}
In this exercise, you will set up Praat Integration in your web
browser. There is currently no Praat integration support for
Microsoft's Edge' browser, so if you normally use 'Edge' on Windows,
you may need to swap to another browser for this exercise - e.g.
*Google Chrome*, or *Mozilla Firefox*.

## Installation

### MFA

MFA is a 3rd-party tool
([https://montrealcorpustools.github.io/Montreal-Forced-Aligner/](https://montrealcorpustools.github.io/Montreal-Forced-Aligner))
that LaBB-CAT integrates with via a Layer Manager module. MFA is not
included as part of LaBB-CAT, and so it must be installed on the server
you have installed LaBB-CAT on before you can integrate LaBB-CAT with
it.

If MFA has not been installed already, please follow the following
steps, depending on the operatings system of your LaBB-CAT server:

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
#### Linux

To install the Montreal Forced Aligner on Linux systems for all users,
so that your web server can access it if required:

1.  Download Miniconda:\
    `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38\_4.10.3-Linux-x86\_64.sh`
2.  Start the installer:\
    `sudo bash Miniconda3-py38\_4.10.3-Linux-x86\_64.sh`
3.  When asked the location to install Miniconda, use:\
    `/opt/conda`
4.  When asked whether the installer should initialize Miniconda, this
    is unnecessary so you can respond `no`
5.  Change ownership of the conda files):\
    `sudo chown -R $USERNAME:$USERNAME /opt/conda`
6.  Make conda accessible to all users (so you web server can access
    MFA):\
    `chmod -R go-w /opt/conda`\
    `chmod -R go+rX /opt/conda`
7.  Install the Montreal Forced Aligner\
    `/opt/conda/bin/conda create -n aligner -c conda-forge montreal-forced-aligner=2.2.17`
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
#### Windows

To install the Montreal Forced Aligner on Windows systems for all users,
so that your web server can access it if required:

1.  Download the Miniconda installer:   \
    <https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe>
2.  Start the installer by double-clicking it.
3.  When asked, select the "Install for all users" option. This will
    install conda somewhere like\
    *C:\\ProgramData\\Miniconda3*
4.  When asked, tick the *add to PATH* option.
5.  Install the Montreal Forced Aligner by specifying a path to the
    environment\
    `conda create -c conda-forge -p C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\envs\aligner montreal-forced-aligner=2.2.17`

If you have problems getting MFA working on Windows, check *Troubleshooting on Windows* section of the [MFA Installation instructions](../../howto/forced-alignment/mfa-install.html#callout-3).
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
#### Docker Container

If your LaBB-CAT server is installed in a Docker Container, it can
download and install Miniconda and MFA itself, as part of the process of
installing the MFA Manager (below)

There is no need for a separate installation of the MFA software.
:::

### MFA Manager

Once MFA has been installed, you have to install the MFA Manager, which
is the LaBB-CAT module that provides MFA with all the data it needs, and
then saves to alignments MFA produces back to your database.

(@) Select the *layer managers* menu option.
(@) Follow the *List of layer managers that are not yet installed* link at the bottom.
(@) Find MFA Manager in the list, and press its *Install* button and
    then press *Install* again.\
    \
    As long as MFA has been installed for all users, you should see a
    box that's already filled in with the location that MFA was
    installed to in the *Path to MFA* box.\
    \
    If the *Path to MFA* box is empty and there's an *Attempt to
    Install MFA* button, click the button, and LaBB-CAT will try to
    install MFA on the server for you. This process can take a few
    minutes, and the *Configure* button will be disabled until it's
    finished.
(@) Press *Configure* to continue the layer manager installation.\
    You will see a window open with some information about integrating
    with MFA, including the information you've already read above.
(@) Now you need to add a *phrase layer* for the MFA configuration:
    -   **Layer ID:** `mfa`
    -   **Type:** *Text*
    -   **Alignment:** *Intervals*
    -   **Manager:** *MFA Manager*
    -   **Generate:** *always*
    -   **Description:** `MFA alignment time`

:::{.callout-note}
After saving the layer, the MFA configuraion form will appear.

Initially, there will be a 'spinner' and the form will be disabled while LaBB-CAT is making internet requests in order to retrieve lists of available dictionaries and acoustic models.

This process may take a few seconds, depending on LaBB-CAT's connection to the internet.
:::

(@) When you configure the layer, set the following options:
    -   **Dictionary Name:** *english_mfa*
    -   **Pretrained Acoustic Models:** *english_mfa*
    -   The rest of the options can be left as their default values.

:::{.callout-tip}
If you're curious about what the configuration options do,
hover your mouse over each option to see a 'tool tip' that
describes what the option is for.
:::

(@) Press *Set Parameters*
    We will not click *Regenerate* to force-align the whole corpus just
    yet. We need to tweak a few other settings, and then align a single
    participant's speech.
    
When forced-alignment is done, the resulting aligned phones will be
saved on the *segment* layer. By default, this has it's type set to
*Phonological*, which assumes that the phoneme symbols will be those
defined by the CELEX DISC encoding. However, MFA uses its own
phoneme symbols, which are different from the CELEX DISC ones.

To make later processing easier, we're going to change the type of
the *segment* layer to *Text*, and let LaBB-CAT know what the
possible phoneme labels are.

(@) Select the *segment layers* menu option.\
    You will see a single layer listed, called *segment*.
(@) Change the *Type* of the *segment* layer to *Text*.
(@) Press *Save*.\
    A new icon appears with a tag ![](tag.svg) icon -
    if you hover the mouse over this button, you'll see it's for
    setting *Valid labels*.
(@) Click the *Valid labels* icon\
    You will see a page that allows you to add a list of possible
    labels.\
    But we don't know what the valid labels are yet. The labels used by
    MFA depend on the dictionary/models selected when defining the
    layer. The details for all dictionaries are in [MFA Models
    documentation](https://mfa-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dictionary/index.html#dictionary).
(@) Open the [MFA Models documentation for
    *english\_mfa*](https://mfa-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dictionary/English/English%20MFA%20dictionary%20v2_0_0.html#English%20MFA%20dictionary%20v2_0_0).\
    You will see a page that includes information about the dictionary
    including the *Phones* used by it.
(@) Select and copy the list of phones used by the *english_mfa*
    dictionary - i.e. all of these:\
    `a aj aw aː b bʲ c cʰ d dʒ dʲ e ej f fʲ h i iː j k kʰ l m mʲ m̩ n n̩ o ow p pʰ pʲ s t tʃ tʰ tʲ u uː v vʲ w z æ ç ð ŋ ɐ ɑ ɑː ɒ ɒː ɔ ɔj ə əw ɚ ɛ ɛː ɜ ɜː ɝ ɟ ɡ ɪ ɫ ɫ̩ ɱ ɲ ɹ ɾ ʃ ʉ ʉː ʊ ʎ ʒ ʔ θ`
14. Back in the *Valid Labels* page in LaBB-CAT, paste all of the phone
    symbols into the box labelled *Label*\
    ![The Valid Labels form with the text box filled with all the MFA
    phoneme symbols](pasted-mfa-labels.png)
(@) Press *New*.\
    You will see that all of the labels are separately added to the list
    of valid labels.\
    ![The Valid Labels list is now populated, with each phoneme symbol
    on a separate line](valid-mfa-labels-list.png)
    
Defining this list for the *segment* layer means that, when you
search the *segment* layer for specific phones, LaBB-CAT can display
a clickable list of possibilities.

(@) At the bottom of the list, there's a *Save* button. Click it to
    save your changes.
    
## Alignment

(@) Select the *participants* option on the menu.
(@) Find the participant *UC207YW* and tick their checkbox.

:::{.callout-note}
Although we're only going to force-align the utterances of a single speaker in this exercise, you can align the utterances of multiple speakers at once, by ticking all their checkboxes on the *participants* page before continuing with the next step...
:::

(@) Press the *All Utterances* button above the list of participants
(@) Press *List*.\
    You will see a progress bar while all their utterances are
    identified. Then a results page will be displayed, listing the first
    20 utterances.
(@) Click the *Mfa* button at the bottom.\
    You will see a progress bar appear, while LaBB-CAT gathers the files
    that MFA needs, runs MFA, and parses the resulting alignments. This
    will take a few minutes.

## Inspection/Correction

Once forced alignment is complete, you can inspect/correct alignments using LaBB-CAT's integration with Praat.

(@) Go to the *transcripts* page and open the *UC207YW.eaf* transcript.
(@) Tick both the *mfa* layer and the *segment* layer. \
    You will see which lines have been force-aligned, as they have an
    MFA timestamp, and have the *segment* layer filled in.\
    
The interactive transcript page doesn't show you the alignments of
the words or phones, but you can see those using Praat. You can open
individual utterances in Praat directly from the transcript page,
but first, the LaBB-CAT/Praat integration has to be set up; this
only has to be done once:

i.  On the top-right of the page, above the playback controls, there's
    a Praat icon  - click it.
ii. Follow the instructions that appear (these vary depending on what
    web browser you use).\
    You may be asked whether to allow the "LaBB-CAT Integration Applet"
    to run. If you tick the "Do not show this again" option, then this
    message will not appear every time you open a transcript.\
    You may need to grant a browser extension permission to install, and
    it's possible you will need a connection to the internet in order
    to download this extension.\
    You also may be asked where Praat is installed; Navigate to the
    location where Praat is installed, and double-click the "Praat.exe"
    file (on some systems the file may simply be called "Praat"). The
    Praat program may open, and then immediately close, as LaBB-CAT
    tests it can communicate with Praat.
    
Now Praat integration has been set up, and you should be able to
access Praat options in the transcript page from now on...

(@) Click on a line that has been aligned, and select the *Open Text
    Grid in Praat* option on the menu.\
    You may be asked you if want to allow access to the "LaBB-CAT
    Integration Applet" - if so, tick "Do not show this again", and
    click *Allow*.\
    Praat should open, and show you a spectrogram of the line's audio,
    with a TextGrid below that includes the words and the segments.
(@) If you click on a word, and hit the {{< kbd tab >}} key, the word's
    interval is played. Try out various words, and see what you think
    about how accurate HTK has been with its alignment.\
    Try this out with different lines in the transcript.\
    You will see that in some cases the alignment is pretty good, and in
    other cases, it's not so good. In the not-so-good cases, see if you
    can figure out why HTK got it wrong.\

You may have noticed that, each time you open an utterance in Praat,
a button appears in the transcript to the left of the line, labelled
*Import Changes*. This button allows you to save any adjustments you
might want to make to the alignments back into the LaBB-CAT
database.

27. If you feel confident using Praat, open an utterance TextGrid,
    adjust the alignments of the words an phones so that they're more
    accurate, and then click the *Import Changes* button in the
    transcript.

:::{.callout-warning}
These changes are flagged as manual edits, so if forced-alignment is
run again, they will not be over-written with new bad alignments.
Therefore it's important that the changes you make are actually
improvements, because HTK will never change them again.
:::

:::{.callout-important}
There are some rules about what you can change:
1.  You're not allowed to add or delete words (if this is
    necessary, it should be done by correcting the transcript
    instead).
2.  All the phones must be within the bounds of their own word.
3.  The start of the first phone should line up with the start of
    the word, and the end of the last phone should line up with the
    end of the word.
4.  You should not change the alignment of the utterance itself
    (which would only be possible if you select the *Open Text Grid
    incl. ± 1 utterance in Praat* option).
:::

In this exercise, you have seen how MFA can be used to compute word and
phone alignments automatically from your data, and when using a
pronunciation dictionary and pre-trained acoustic models, the process is
very straightforward.

Such dictionaries/models are only available for a limited number of
languages, but if you have a pronunciation dictionary for the language
your corpus uses, MFA can also be used to train its own acoustic models
from your corpus, and then use them for forced alignment. This process
involves a fair amount of careful transcription, tagging, and dictionary
filling.

Perfect automatic alignments are not guaranteed, but LaBB-CAT has a
mechanism for manually correcting poor alignments.
